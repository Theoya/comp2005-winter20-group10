# for the `RicochetRobots` class, we have 4 instances of `Player` class and we use `p1.getPlayerName()` method to get the string of the name of the player, however, the code doesn't show the string of the name of the player and instead it shows "Enter the name of Player4". We double-checked our logic and code, and we couldn't find any errors. This bug comes out when the bidding window appears and each player have to enter the bidding number. It also shows when the bidding ends and the game shows which player bid the lowest and outputs the number of bids next to their names.
# We wanted to increase the cohesion for `RicochetRobots` class, so to decrease its functionality and make it only take care of a single task, however, due to the time constriction and the fact that every team member was busy, it was really hard and challenging to do so, we have tried our best in having multiple classes and making the code clear for everyone
