We changed from creating use-case and sequence diagram for "verifying routes" to "Make a move". The reason behind this change is that it
would have taken more time for us to implement code for "verifying routes".
In our implementation, the code can only detect the borders of the board, and not any barriers of tiles. Prof. Mark said that it is fine
for this iteration. However, we have to pick up pace for the next iteration.
